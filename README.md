# CODE CHALLENGE WEEK 2 REPO
Creating a simple Event Guest List Manager that uses JavaScript to manipulate the DOM.
Working with forms, capturing user input, and updating the page dynamically using JavaScript â€” all without refreshing the browser.

1. index.html: your HTML layout
2. src/index.js: your JavaScript logic
3. style.css: your styling

## Deliverables
As a user:

-You should be able to type a guest's name into the input field.
-You should be able to click a submit button to add the guest.
-You should see the guest's name appear in a list on the page after I submit the form.
-You should be able to remove a guest from the list using a delete button.

The guest list is limited to 10 people
